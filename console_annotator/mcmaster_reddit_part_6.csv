1037,The crush part is funny lol. This isn't middle school ??,
1038,agreed. A bit of talking here and there is whatever because it comes and goes so it isn't super distracting. But when there's people YAPPPPPINGGGGG away it's like- why even show up to lecture??? You're clearly not paying attention ??,
1039,"Literally! It is so disrespectful too people are trying to focus and actually learn, some are even paying their own tuition, then you have these spoiled people just yapping about irrelevant things.",
1040,"But Jake told Courtney and Mackensay he liked her. We'll have to wait for next episode of McMaster Heights.

1049,"i work in CATS! if people around you aren't shutting up, please come up to the front desk and we will tell the students to be quiet, repeatedly, if necessary. if they're still yapping, we can always report them to our manager and she can give them an official warning",
1050,"Engineer here. I can literally only apply maybe 2 courses out of the 34 I’ve taken to my co-op rn… and neither went in depth enough for me to be able to do anything on my own. 
This is so embarrassing and taking a huge toll on my mental health because I feel like they expect so much more from me and are paying me to be useless. I cried at work so many times now because I feel so stupid. I don’t even know if I’m in the right career anymore because I can’t think logically like an engineer. 
I literally can’t think am I genuinely stupid",
1051,Of course you won't be using everything you learned at school. The degree is to teach you how to teach yourself. You're at your co-op to learn how to work.,
1052,"Totally normal! You are new to things and are learning. if they make you feel stupid, that’s on them, might not be a great employer. 90% of the stuff you do at work has no connection to school tbh. 

Be helpful, do your best, act like you care about the work, be humble, and ask questions when you don’t know. As a co-op student, if you do those things, you will be successful. 

Take the lessons from this place as a learning. Be confident, you got this and deserve to be there!",
1053,Nah completely normal. Theoretical uni knowledge will give you a strong base but no practical experience. The whole point of the co-op you are on right now is for you to gain that practical experience lol.,

1056,"Trust me, I felt like I was pretty knowledgeable in my field (so far), but I felt kinda clueless when I started my co-op, even though I knew what to expect from the start. Nothing will teach you how to do the job well except doing the job itself, every position has its quirks. Don’t worry, you are in the stage everyone starts at.",
1057,I’m on coop rn too and have no clue what’s going on. You’re there to learn; companies do not expect much from coop students. Just do your best and put forth a genuine effort.,

Like someone cared. I honestly want to nominate them for something! I know there was the TA award thing from earlier but I only had this TA this semester and missed out. Is it too late for any other awards? Nobody else helped. Other TAs would yell at me


If they find this: thanks so much for making this semester more bearable. I thought I was in the deep end and was going to call it quits but you genuinely made an impact. Thank you again! :D engineering is so difficult alone both academically and mentally and it helps immensely to know somebody out there cares and wants you to succeed.",

holy mother mary i did so incredibly ass on that please someone tell me it doesn’t matter. 

Genuinely I couldn’t say a single word. Like not a single thought came to my mind. I was so stuttery, couldn’t get any point across. there was 0 detail to whatever i was saying. it was very bare minimum. 

my written response was good though. way easier for me to think straight and get a point across when im writing. and im generally a good writer. 
but the video responses….. absolutely not. especially with the fact that we only get 1 minute to prepare. pisses me off tho cus i have good vocabulary and i’m able to properly articulate my thoughts when im writing or even when speaking as well as long as i’m calm and don’t feel like i’m put on the spot. 

that supp app does not represent me at all. if u spoke to me irl it would be incredibly different. like bye buddy i couldn’t even tell u my favourite color. i literally said NOTHING in those responses. my vocab was CHEEKS. that isn’t me. i’m never that nervous . 

my life is over now ggs. mac was my top pick i didn’t even apply to any other good schools. i love mac. mac is my dream. mac is the light at the end of the tunnel. mac is a shooting star, glistening in the darkness of space. mac is a warm campfire on a cold summer night. ",

But I would love to hear some of your personal favourites",
1116,"Let me cook 

Top tier places:
Ancaster Mill - my personal favourite in Hamilton but ridiculously expensive. Worth it for a special occasion.

Pintoh - Thai restaurant, super reasonably priced 

Em Oi - Vietnamese place, super good and reasonable prices 

Undefined - more $$ but extremely extremely good 

Tomah - not sit down but super great Syrian food 

Rony’s - Iraqi place, again not sit down but amazing chicken wraps and sandwiches
 
Mesa - extemely cheap and tasty Mexican place, can get a lot of food for $15 sit down 

Szechuan Noodle Bowl - sit down or take out, best noodles in Hamilton imo. Only $12 for a lot food

Other good places:
Rapscallion - insanely expensive but super unique menu and iconic in Hamilton 

Berkeley North - kind of like rapscallion lite, still expensive but not as bad, with a unique menu
 
The Ship - sit down burger and fries place near st joes

Ajio - sushi place, probably the most popular sushi restaurant in Hamilton 

Barangas on the Beach - Greek food, right on the water (literally the beach) so very good atmosphere in the summer 

Perfect Meat Bowl - Chinese meat bowl place, a lot of my friends are obsessed with this place (imo it’s great but not amazing)

Aberdeen Tavern - amazing homey, antique atmosphere. Food is good too",
1117,"Love Mesa downtown, fantastic Mexican food",
1118,"Hamilton has SUCH incredible food let me give you some of my favourites.

May’s Thai Kitchen. My favourite Thai food in Hamilton (Pintoh’s is good too) run by an older Thai lady who is so lovely. 

Hamilton Farmers Market. Mays Thai Kitchen is in HFM and honestly I love that place so much. So many family owned businesses that love what they do. Lina’s pastry has some fantastic Portuguese tarts

Namu in Dundas. Asian fusion spot with a really thoughtful and delicious menu, a nice dinner spot 

Le Tambour. On the pricier side, good for a special occasion everything is delicious 

Mai Pai. Bit far but worth the commute, my favourite pizza in Hamilton by far (sorry Cowabunga) 

Miss Lyns Wings. Family owned spot with fantastic chicken wings. Another great chicken spot is Golden Tenders can’t go wrong with either 

Close to Mac, my favourite will always be my beloved Nannas in Westdale. Hungry Donkey being a close second.",

1121,Saigon House (the one downtown. It's unrelated to the westdale one) is my favorite restaurant in the city hands down. The a la carte or the all u can eat BBQ are both very reasonably priced and everything tastes amazing,

1123,Plank Restobar on Augusta is so good especially if you like sharing with your partner/friends!,
1124,"The arch noodle house right near campus is SO FUCKING GOOD. I go there whenever I can. They don’t accept meal card but it’s so worth it, the ramen they have is so good, the udon is even better, the RANGOONS???? ugh. It’s just so good. It’s not too expensive but it isn’t cheap either, but the food portions are pretty huge so I’d say it’s worth it. My personal faves are the vegetable fried udon and the hot sesame noodles with a fried egg on top.. I’m craving it right now as I type",

I am so genuinely serious when I say this but please do not go there, please stop your friends from going there, and please let that place rot until its forced to go out of business. What a disgusting pathetic excuse of ""shawarma"" they've got going on in there. Not even their ""garlic"" sauce has any hint of garlic in it. It is genuinely utter slop food for the lowest of your lows. 

Can you imagine? You're a student at mac, you just finished a stressful exam, or maybe you have an exam coming up, or maybe hey, you just need a little nutritional boost before going to the gym. Let's go to Westdale and try something out! Ah! Perfect! Lazeez Shawarma! I love shawarma! 

Only to be met by the most slop food you've ever had in your entire life. It genuinely feels like youre filling your mouth with ai generated food if that makes any sense. Like theres an attempt at trying to create flavour and yet nothing happens, theres no magic, theres not even a moment where you think ""yum"". You just keep taking bites hoping the next one won't taste like TV static.

We as a community need to warn others and be informed to run this place out of business and out of westdale. It is a joke of a franchise and the food is a slap on the face for any poor souls that've never tried it before (me). Its utter trash! It literally robs people out of their money. There are SO many other better restaurants as gimmicky as they may be that can replace it. 

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk. Please remember never to try Lazeez Shawarma and never to spend a penny or even a minute of your time at such a piss poor quality franchise. Your pocket and tastebuds deserve better. ",

It might just be that lazeez, im sure other locations better",

1179,"yesterday i spent like 3 hours fantasizing about the different types of furniture, specifically couches and chairs, that I would buy when I'm older. I was excited while browsing refrigerators. I was thinking about the types of rugs I would order. I spent a good 10 hours browsing vacuums with my mom. I quit weed. I don't drink anymore. I am excited about antitrust now and was decently happy while browsing boring ass account sheets for companies. 

My friend was talking about wanting to be a dinner party adult instead of a rock climbing one. We both wanted to be 6AM runner adults. It's over. I am cooked. I can feel the responsibility bleeding into my life.

Enjoy this time when it lasts. Otherwise you will become like me. ",
1180,when you start to actually like kale. 10 year old me would not recognize this person.,
1181,"It's a natural part of life. Everyone will have to become an adult at one point, and there's nothing wrong with it.

Although I'll add, fantasizing being an adult and, actually being an adult, along with considering the responsibilities and inevitable stress that comes with it are 2 very different things. 

Imho, you haven't lost your innocence yet, but you're getting there.",
1182,"Furniture is beautiful  
Everyone likes to decorate their space, your tastes just change as you grow older --- it's a natural process, but that doesn't mean you'll grow out of everything you enjoy

the things that really matter to you, they stay with you

and isn't it so wonderful now to find joy in places you never have before?  
Joy in the mundane",
1183,"Hey man, at least it’s the nice parts of life. It’s worse when you surrender your soul to the realization that you’ll never escape capitalism",
1184,At what age do you start to suffer from this?,
1185,don't be a rock climbing adult fr though. that hobby is lame.,
1186,"We all change, it doesn’t mean we’ve lost anything! How lucky we are to be growing older",
1187,Any tips to do well in first midterms ,
1188,if its with xu I would suggest you start praying,
1189,I saw the Mac post about it. congrats to the winner but what does the disqualification of one of the candidates mean I’m confused ,
1190,it means that they have accrued too many violations and have been automatically disqualified as per election rules! they still have the option to appeal the fines so keep an eye out,
1191,"You all get a 12 in bus etiquette. Beautiful work. Every seat was filled, all the way to the back. Bags were on laps or on the floor. People even stood at the very back of the bus!! Nobody blocked the exits and everyone was able to exit easily. I have never witnessed such beauty. May this day go down in history with glory ??????",
1192,HSR Beauty Ambassador is here guys,
1193,"If you commute you’re probably aware of these problems and might’ve just accepted them. Have you been on the waitlist for 8 months? That’s not an unfortunate accident, Lot M is half empty every day. McMaster makes the bulk of its money at Lot M through the commuters that are not on the waitlist. If you get off the waitlist McMaster loses money. You will keep playing $8 a day until someone else can replace you on the waitlist as their cash cow. And the waitlist resets yearly.

This is bad enough, paying $160 a month for parking at the uni you already pay massive amounts of tuition to, just for them to pocket the money for profit. If you aren’t convinced Mac doesn’t give a fuck about you and is taking advantage, here’s another lot M anecdote.

A couple months ago the machines suddenly, due to a “bug in the system” (parking employee) charged $12 for lot M instead of $8 for two days. This isn’t much, true. But McMaster charged this amount, never addressed it, never returned it. If we assume 1000 people came into lot M those two days, that’s about $8000 extra. Not a small amount. Money that could’ve improved the shuttle busses that have gotten shittier and shittier, or payed the shuttle drivers more. It 100% just became surplus (illegally accrued) profit.

The commuters are easy to take advantage of. We’re a formless mass of people with no unity, and McMaster will take advantage of you for your whole time here. Bring these problems up to whoever you can! Your MSU elects, CUPE, anyone who has ears. Every problem at the school we acknowledge and work to fix will benefit the students, profs, employees (everyone but the upper administration and shareholders). Set a good precedent and don’t let yourselves get walked over, even in the seemingly small issues! For profit they will step on you.",
1194,I remember randomly paying $12 for parking one day. No explanation was given and I still haven't heard anything about it.,
1195,I don't got pull like that but if there's a movement I'll just be a supporting vote,
1196,Unfortunate. Can students pack on any lot with a pass or is it strictly lot m?,
1197,"I don’t know what some people are on but it doesn’t take long to wash your hands after taking a piss. I’ve seen so many guys not wash their hands and then go workout in pulse. Like at least have some hygiene. If you don’t have time to wash your hands, then carry a hand sanitizer or something in your pockets. Just keep your hands clean before touching equipments. ",
1198,ewww gross. kindergarteners have more common sense than this.,

2,"Im so dumb, I commute 1.5hrs to McMaster. I forgot my laptop charger and need to do an online kin test that requires respondus. What should I do? Is there anywhere that I can use a computer but it needs a camera. My laptop is at 11%",
3,I’m trying to graduate in fall and have 5 courses left. Would it be possible to do them all over summer break (without needing permission from faculty) or would I need to take fall semester? ,
4,"Hey everyone! I'm in the commerce internship program \*phase 2\* and I've already rejected this one offer I got in phase 2.

Ik we're only allowed to reject one offer per phase. Has anyone in this phase or who has been in the program in the past rejected more than one offers and still remained in the internship program? Cuz Ik they're like oh you may get kicked out. ",
5,"I know I know, it's gonna be covered with the gown but I'm wondering what I(F) should wear underneath that matches the neckline of the gown. Should I do a collared shirt? A turtleneck? Or it doesn't matter at all since the gown will completely cover it?",
