Hey everyone,

I’m planning to apply for a master’s in biochemistry at McMaster this fall, and I’m looking for advice on how to approach potential supervisors. I’m an international student, currently living in Guelph, so I wouldn’t be able to speak to them in person right away. I’d like to formally introduce myself through email, but I’m worried my emails might just get lost in the thousands they probably receive.

How do I make my email stand out? Of course, I know I need to include the basics like who I am, why I want to work with them, and my experience, but is there anything else I should include to grab their attention or show that I’m serious about joining their lab?

If any of you have gone through this process (especially master’s students at McMaster), I’d really appreciate your tips! What strategies worked for you? How did you structure your emails?

Any advice would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!",

636,"Hello,
I’m currently a final year student at uofa who has already applied to the MSc OT program at Mcmaster for the upcoming fall intake. Those of you who are currently in the program or already graduated from it, what would you say is a competitive gpa that would grant you acceptance into the program? I currently hold a 3.5 and would most likely be able to keep it by the end of this semester. I’ve already submitted my transcript to ORPAS as well. Just wondering what my chances are of getting accepted with a 3.5, given the minimum is a 3.3. 

Thanks in advance! :) ",

I’m a grade 11 high school student in alberta. I took chemistry 30 during this semester but I ended with an 88%. Since this doesn’t meet requirements for mcmaster health science, Im thinking to retake this course online over the summer. Would they care that I retook a course and that I did it through summer school? Some people told me that they dont prefer summer school courses and penalize you for it by preferring students who did the course during school. Is this true?",

657,"Note: this post may come off like a little bit of a vent (which it partially is).

I am kinda coming here as a last resort. I’m in first year B-Tech (automotive stream) and unfortunately block enrolled in our courses. Basically, we are given a schedule and have no control over changing it (only applies to first year). Very unfortunate because there’s going to be quite a bit of dental related appointments I need to schedule on Monday evenings. Only problem is that I have a lab on that day and I am a commuter student coming from Mississauga.

Despite being block enrolled, I still wanted to try my luck with going to the JHE office, to which they promptly said that I have no control over my schedule. Even met up online with an academic advisor for B-Tech and she said it wasn’t possible. Even one of the profs of this course (ENGTECH 1EL3) wasn’t able to help. 

Unfortunately a very inconvenient situation. Does anyone know if there is a way to work around this? Or is all hope lost? Monday evenings (for the moment) are the worst time for me to have a class. Idk why but for some reason at the office, I can only book appointments for Monday and Thursday, and there’s no way Thursday will work out.",

664,"Hi guys.
I’m just here right now to get some things off my chest that I feel I have no one else to tell. The problem is me and my mother. She’s an amazing person, but she can be the most difficult people to talk to, or even deal with sometimes. Sometimes, I like to bounce ideas off of her or tell her something I want to do (an extracurricular, volunteering opportunity; etc) and in the end, she makes me feel like a complete idiot for even wanting to do it in the first place. All this, focusing on school, getting into your specialty, “why do you want this so bad” - serious tone. It’s very pressurizing to even talk to her about school. It’s a very big deal to her and I can understand why it is, but sometimes, I feel like she cares more about it than I do. She makes a bigger deal out of things than even I do, and it’s my school and future career. In most cases, it makes me feel sad, embarrassed, or ashamed. Let’s say I didn’t get into the specialty I wanted or wanted to do something else after graduation, it all comes down to, “you worked too hard to get where you’re at!”, etc. I don’t get it. It pushes me down so much I can’t even study or think about anything else but that. It makes me want to refrain from telling her anything about my plans, little or big, but as I said in the beginning, she’s one of the only people I really have to talk to as I’m very introverted and I hate it sometimes that she’s like my only rock. My siblings don’t give a single shit about my life and my dad’s usually on the same page as my mom. Anyways, sorry if this is a long one, I just really wanted to get this out and I think it would be sort of comforting to see what others have to say and know I’m not the only one with this problem.
Take care guys ",
