873,"Hi, 

Today I created an account on Facebook to look for off-campus housing for next year. Before I even finished creating the account, I was suspended for the next 180 days and had to submit an appeal, which I did. One of my friends was banned on Instagram and never got their account back even after the appeal. To this day, meta has neither rejected or accepted their appeal. I tried creating a new account but it turns out I’m IP banned. Given the state of my friend’s appeal, its likely that my appeal won’t be reviewed either. I’m not sure if my Instagram account will be banned soon either.

That being said, what other platforms are there to look for off-campus housing near Mac? I’m really worried now since everyone’s saying to look on Facebook, but now I can’t do that. I also don’t have a group to rent with either. Where else could I look to find a place to rent? ",

892,"I'm kind of freaking out. I took 1LS3 in semester 1, after dropping out of 1A03 to take it. The first few days I was really confused and found 1LS3 to be better. I did not have a great high school calculus class and so my skills weren't great. I passed 1LS3, and I probably could have done better had I managed my time better, but my grade first semester wasn't great (C+). After doing some research, chemistry and chemical biology don't recommend one calculus course over the other. The most I can find for 1AA3 being recommended is for chemical and physical sciences, but 1LS3 is still acceptable, I would just have to do additional work to bridge gaps for certain courses.

I was in 1AA3, but I dropped it and changed into 1LT3. I talked to some people who work at the desks in the departments (I believe they are the academic advisors), and chemistry and chemical biology said most students took 1LT3, but the math department recommended 1AA3 because it was aimed for the chemical and physical sciences. However, they did say that a math person would always recommend it over 1LT3 because it's pure math, and that if I felt better taking it as it was a more straight forward transition and had a good prof, than that was also okay and they might even recommend that more.

I'm afraid I made the wrong choice choosing 1LT3 and it's causing me a lot of stress. I don't know if I'd be able to switch back into 1AA3 if I've picked the wrong choice, either. I need some advice; do I try to go back to 1AA3, or am I worrying over nothing? If your someone in chemistry in an upper year, would I be at a disadvantage? I've read that a lot of linear algebra (which I will be taking regardless of which calc course I'm in later) and differential equations are used in chemistry, like physical and quantum. I don't know what sort of chemistry I want to pursue. 

I'm not terrible at math, and I would prefer to choose 1LT3 simply because I have heard Clements is great and it's an easier transition from 1LS3. I feel like choosing the 'easier' path isn't necessarily the 'best' path. If choosing 1LT3 would be bad for what I want to go into, I could probably do okay in 1AA3. I may go to grad school later on, and I don't know if that will affect anything. 

tldr; am I screwed later on for chemistry if I take 1LT3 and not 1AA3?",

I noticed some on the entrance sign and on the big glass windows in MUSC but have seen it in multiple places.

1031,has anyone ever taken this class? i want to take it for spring/summer but i want something that’s not a heavy workload ,
1032,I’ve applied for business 1 and have a 93% Highschool average. I’m considering the optional supplementary application but a question involves how often you volunteer. I have no volunteer hours or sport activities outside of the 40 needed to graduate. Is it better to just not submit it than to say I don’t have any in that segment? Would they know if I did any outside of school and didn’t submit the hours for whatever reason or is that suspicious to them?,
1033,"Are there other questions on the application besides the volunteer question? If so, I would submit it. It helps them get to know you. 

You did volunteer - 40 hours. Explain you did volunteer, what you learned etc. if you want, include why you didn't volunteer beyond the required number. There are loads of reasons why you might not have additional volunteer hours e.g. you needed to have a job to help support you/your family (and thus didn't have additional time for volunteering), you have medical issues and never found a volunteer role that was accommodating, wanting to focus on academics, etc.

They won't know what you don't tell them / submit to them.",
1034,"First off I want to say you don’t need the supplemental with an average above 90, you can easily get in without it.  Second off you can bend the truth or inflate it they will not contact you to figure out the legitimacy, there’s people I know who only did 40h and they told me they forged them anyway so you should be fine! Worst case just say you babysit for your neighbours free of charge and that’s you volunteering ?? Anyway I’m fairly certain you will be accepted with a 93 average so don’t worry about it you’ll get the acceptance soon ????Premature congratulations to you.",
