2,"Im so dumb, I commute 1.5hrs to McMaster. I forgot my laptop charger and need to do an online kin test that requires respondus. What should I do? Is there anywhere that I can use a computer but it needs a camera. My laptop is at 11%",
3,I’m trying to graduate in fall and have 5 courses left. Would it be possible to do them all over summer break (without needing permission from faculty) or would I need to take fall semester? ,
4,"Hey everyone! I'm in the commerce internship program \*phase 2\* and I've already rejected this one offer I got in phase 2.

Ik we're only allowed to reject one offer per phase. Has anyone in this phase or who has been in the program in the past rejected more than one offers and still remained in the internship program? Cuz Ik they're like oh you may get kicked out. ",
5,"I know I know, it's gonna be covered with the gown but I'm wondering what I(F) should wear underneath that matches the neckline of the gown. Should I do a collared shirt? A turtleneck? Or it doesn't matter at all since the gown will completely cover it?",
6,"I don’t know what some people are on but it doesn’t take long to wash your hands after taking a piss. I’ve seen so many guys not wash their hands and then go workout in pulse. Like at least have some hygiene. If you don’t have time to wash your hands, then carry a hand sanitizer or something in your pockets. Just keep your hands clean before touching equipments. ",
7,"If you commute you’re probably aware of these problems and might’ve just accepted them. Have you been on the waitlist for 8 months? That’s not an unfortunate accident, Lot M is half empty every day. McMaster makes the bulk of its money at Lot M through the commuters that are not on the waitlist. If you get off the waitlist McMaster loses money. You will keep playing $8 a day until someone else can replace you on the waitlist as their cash cow. And the waitlist resets yearly.

This is bad enough, paying $160 a month for parking at the uni you already pay massive amounts of tuition to, just for them to pocket the money for profit. If you aren’t convinced Mac doesn’t give a fuck about you and is taking advantage, here’s another lot M anecdote.

A couple months ago the machines suddenly, due to a “bug in the system” (parking employee) charged $12 for lot M instead of $8 for two days. This isn’t much, true. But McMaster charged this amount, never addressed it, never returned it. If we assume 1000 people came into lot M those two days, that’s about $8000 extra. Not a small amount. Money that could’ve improved the shuttle busses that have gotten shittier and shittier, or payed the shuttle drivers more. It 100% just became surplus (illegally accrued) profit.

The commuters are easy to take advantage of. We’re a formless mass of people with no unity, and McMaster will take advantage of you for your whole time here. Bring these problems up to whoever you can! Your MSU elects, CUPE, anyone who has ears. Every problem at the school we acknowledge and work to fix will benefit the students, profs, employees (everyone but the upper administration and shareholders). Set a good precedent and don’t let yourselves get walked over, even in the seemingly small issues! For profit they will step on you.",
8,"You all get a 12 in bus etiquette. Beautiful work. Every seat was filled, all the way to the back. Bags were on laps or on the floor. People even stood at the very back of the bus!! Nobody blocked the exits and everyone was able to exit easily. I have never witnessed such beauty. May this day go down in history with glory ??????",
9,I saw the Mac post about it. congrats to the winner but what does the disqualification of one of the candidates mean I’m confused ,
10,Any tips to do well in first midterms ,
11,"yesterday i spent like 3 hours fantasizing about the different types of furniture, specifically couches and chairs, that I would buy when I'm older. I was excited while browsing refrigerators. I was thinking about the types of rugs I would order. I spent a good 10 hours browsing vacuums with my mom. I quit weed. I don't drink anymore. I am excited about antitrust now and was decently happy while browsing boring ass account sheets for companies. 

My friend was talking about wanting to be a dinner party adult instead of a rock climbing one. We both wanted to be 6AM runner adults. It's over. I am cooked. I can feel the responsibility bleeding into my life.

Enjoy this time when it lasts. Otherwise you will become like me. ",
12,"I have never in my life tasted food so utterly bland, and so utterly horrendous and disgusting to the point where I felt the need to not only protest for my money back after the meal but also immediately leave a negative review on Google Maps and follow it up by telling everyone about my awful experience there. 

I am so genuinely serious when I say this but please do not go there, please stop your friends from going there, and please let that place rot until its forced to go out of business. What a disgusting pathetic excuse of ""shawarma"" they've got going on in there. Not even their ""garlic"" sauce has any hint of garlic in it. It is genuinely utter slop food for the lowest of your lows. 

Can you imagine? You're a student at mac, you just finished a stressful exam, or maybe you have an exam coming up, or maybe hey, you just need a little nutritional boost before going to the gym. Let's go to Westdale and try something out! Ah! Perfect! Lazeez Shawarma! I love shawarma! 

Only to be met by the most slop food you've ever had in your entire life. It genuinely feels like youre filling your mouth with ai generated food if that makes any sense. Like theres an attempt at trying to create flavour and yet nothing happens, theres no magic, theres not even a moment where you think ""yum"". You just keep taking bites hoping the next one won't taste like TV static.

We as a community need to warn others and be informed to run this place out of business and out of westdale. It is a joke of a franchise and the food is a slap on the face for any poor souls that've never tried it before (me). Its utter trash! It literally robs people out of their money. There are SO many other better restaurants as gimmicky as they may be that can replace it. 

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk. Please remember never to try Lazeez Shawarma and never to spend a penny or even a minute of your time at such a piss poor quality franchise. Your pocket and tastebuds deserve better. ",

holy mother mary i did so incredibly ass on that please someone tell me it doesn’t matter. 

Genuinely I couldn’t say a single word. Like not a single thought came to my mind. I was so stuttery, couldn’t get any point across. there was 0 detail to whatever i was saying. it was very bare minimum. 

my written response was good though. way easier for me to think straight and get a point across when im writing. and im generally a good writer. 
but the video responses….. absolutely not. especially with the fact that we only get 1 minute to prepare. pisses me off tho cus i have good vocabulary and i’m able to properly articulate my thoughts when im writing or even when speaking as well as long as i’m calm and don’t feel like i’m put on the spot. 

that supp app does not represent me at all. if u spoke to me irl it would be incredibly different. like bye buddy i couldn’t even tell u my favourite color. i literally said NOTHING in those responses. my vocab was CHEEKS. that isn’t me. i’m never that nervous . 

my life is over now ggs. mac was my top pick i didn’t even apply to any other good schools. i love mac. mac is my dream. mac is the light at the end of the tunnel. mac is a shooting star, glistening in the darkness of space. mac is a warm campfire on a cold summer night. ",

However recently, a really awesome TA helped me out with stuff and I actually felt seen here.

Like someone cared. I honestly want to nominate them for something! I know there was the TA award thing from earlier but I only had this TA this semester and missed out. Is it too late for any other awards? Nobody else helped. Other TAs would yell at me


If they find this: thanks so much for making this semester more bearable. I thought I was in the deep end and was going to call it quits but you genuinely made an impact.

**Engineer Without Borders (EWB) Referendum– $0.41 per student**

* This is the second year in a row that they’re being sent to referendum by the Student Representative Assembly (SRA) which reviews finances and operations of the group yearly
* Previously the $12,000 funding was used to fund 1 McMaster student on a fellowship to East Africa but the fellowship program is now paused due to “restructuring at head office”
* EWB has not been able to access bank accounts or provide accurate financial figures in recent years and haven't offered substantial student programming other than the fellowship which is now paused

$0.41 may not seem like a lot to one student, but it is also $12,000 in the hands of a few students with a history of financial irresponsibility and obscurity.

**Food Accessibility Initiative Referendum– $6.50 per student**

* Was in the previous election but did not meet quorum
* Initiative to provide free soup and bread to students (90,000 meals)

**Homecoming and Large Scale Events Referendum– $20 per student**

104,"Hi, I'm a second year engineering student, and because the industry coop search isn't going well, I reached out to a few professors one of whom is showing an interest in continuing with a research internship for the summer. The problem is that he recommended I go through with the work study route instead of NSERC because it's fairly competitive for 2nd year students. I worked a couple of job last summer and managed to pay tuition out of pocket this year, so I didn't apply to OSAP before the Fall term. Instead, I applied to OSAP last week and just received confirmation from them this morning for a loan.

The problem is, however, when I go on AwardSpring the work study program says ""not qualified"" for the winter term. As far as I know, I've met all the requirements by being eligible for an OSAP loan. For the internship, I plan on working during the Summer term, and I understand that the work study application for that opens in March, but why don't I qualify for the Winter term's work study? I'm trying to reach out to the office but they're only giving me that stupid chat bot which is useless.

My second question is if I qualify for the loan, which I have, and choose not to take it, am I still eligible for the work program? The wording on the info page seems to imply this to be the case, but it's still incredibly ambiguous.

So a few months ago I made a post on here about wether or not there were any clubs for car enthusiasts at McMaster.  I got a bunch of people saying that theyd be interested in one if it existed,  but as far as they were concerned there wasn't an established club on campus. I have decided that I want to start one given my passion for cars along the interest people showed in it. I was wondering if anyone knew the process for doing something like this?

I am a fourth year student looking to apply to medical radiation science for september 2025. Medical radiation science piqued my interest so I wanted to apply and give it a try.

I remember when I applied to university programs in 2021, they were like $50/program.

151,"Hey everyone!

I’m currently in the process of deciding between the University of Toronto and McMaster for med school, and I’d love to get some advice. My goal is to specialize in neurology, specifically focusing on clinical practice with less emphasis on research. I’m really interested in getting into the field as quickly and effectively as possible (noting cost effectiveness), so a program that aligns with that is a priority for me.

From what I’ve heard:

* UofT has a strong reputation and tons of resources, but it’s also research-heavy and potentially more competitive/intense.
* McMaster is known for its 3-year program (getting me into the field faster) and its PBL (Problem-Based Learning) approach, which seems more clinically focused.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with these programs or knows about their strengths in neurology. Which one would be better suited for someone who’s less research-oriented and wants to focus on clinical neurology? For some clarity - I would want to do research, just not in Med school, and definitely not full time.

I’m Salome, a graduate student in the MEPP program at McMaster. I’m currently working on a design thinking assignment, and my topic focuses on the experiences of international students with on-campus mental health services.

I’m looking for international students who are willing to share their insights in a short 30-minute interview. The interview can be done online or in person—whichever works best for you! To ensure your privacy, all information shared will be kept strictly confidential, and you’re welcome to participate anonymously if you prefer.

The deadline for my assignment is Tuesday, so I’m hoping to connect as soon as possible. If you’ve had any experience (positive or negative) with campus mental health services and feel comfortable talking about it, I’d be super grateful for your time and input.

Feel free to comment or DM me if you’re interested!

Thank you so much for considering!

Best,
