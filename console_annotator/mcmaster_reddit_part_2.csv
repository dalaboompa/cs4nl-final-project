I didn't think too much about the future, assuming shit would just work out, but I've been looking more into my actual future and am I fucked?

My GPA isn't even good so I won't be getting a co-op either way ig.

I do have quite a bit of side projects and skills in software, eg. Python, HTML/CSS/JS/TS, C, C++, and a bit of Rust, and I have work experience in a lab from high school, as well as some part time busywork stuff in a family friend's store, so my resume looks alright I would say for a first year, but I think the 2.8 GPA is just too major to overlook.

Going off the first physics LONCAPA, which I couldn't even finish, and whatever the hell is happening right now in the physics lectures with the integration and the electrical fields, physics is magnitudes harder than first semester, and the just generally upped difficulty on the other courses, I'm not sure if I can raise my GPA at all.

437,"Hi friends !!

I’ve been independently studying the McMaster Software Engineering curriculum as part of my personal educational journey. 

It’s been an exciting challenge, but I’ve encountered some difficulties, especially as I’m managing financial constraints which prevent me from formally enrolling in courses.

**1. SFWRENG 3A04 - Software Design III: Large System Design\*\***    
**2. SFWRENG 3RA3 - Software Requirements and Security Considerations\*\***    
**3. SFWRENG 3S03 - Software Testing\*\***  

*Could you kindly guide me on how to access lecture slides or assignments for courses 1, 2, and 3? Additionally, if there are any other essential subjects or resources you recommend, I would greatly appreciate your insights.* 

*Thank you in advance !*",

439,"I feel really shitty.

I have a weird relationship with birthdays. I say I don't like mine. People usually forget my birthday. My parents are either disengaged from my life or in their own heads. People always talk about self love and remembering that ""you are loved"" and everything but no one talks about how to reconcile with yourself if you're genuinely not. I am not loved. That is a fact. If I dropped dead tomorrow I guarantee you no one would pull up to the funeral besides my parents (they wouldn't miss me - it'd probably just be an awful reminder of how I was another strike in their ""life of failures"" - never living up to what they wanted). No one remembers me. I know I'm not the center of the universe and that everyone's busy with their own lives but it doesn't feel great to be an afterthought in everyone's lives when you go out of your way to try and make other people feel loved. I'm not angry or bitter, I'm just tired. Maybe I'm being too sensitive about this but I genuinely just want to be loved. Considered. Remembered. I know I should just develop a harder heart and not care whether or not others acknowledge me. I just feel so bruised inside. When you're the one that slips through the cracks again and again, sometimes you forget that you can catch yourself. Sometimes you don't care enough and become someone who can be thrown away. I know I need to get my problems sorted out and talk to someone about how my entire self perception is based on the value of how much others find me worthy but I genuinely can't fucking afford therapy. I know this post was rambling and pathetic, I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm sorry you've read this far if you have. 

TLDR (?): Happy birthday to me. I'm gonna spend today figuring out how to convince grad schools that I'm not a failure while pushing down my self loathing and buy myself a coffee from Williams I guess. ",
