At the start of this year, I thought i'd have passionate discussions with my fellow eng. kids about CAD, robotics, etc. but NO. It seems like the vast majority of first years in eng don't have any passion, and are here because of the $$$, not because they are actually interested in engineering.

I've met people who make me constantly wonder ""how tf did you even get into Mac eng? I think I've lost track of how many people i've met/overheard who literally bragged they took online school advanced functions, calculus and physics because they couldn't handle it in day school. I've met people who pay $20 per month for Chatgpt so it can do Lon-capa, Childsmath assignments , and Matlab code for them. Last night i overheard someone call Dr Childs a f--- piece of s--- because they were furious that they got an 8 in MATH 1ZA3 when they think they deserved at least a 10.

182,"I’m currently not doing as well as I’d like in biology, with an 85 average. I’m considering retaking the course next semester through night school to potentially boost my grade and include it in my top six. Would universities, specifically McMaster and Queens (since I’m applying for Health Science and Life Science), penalize me for this?

I’ve read online that retaking up to two courses is generally fine and that night school/online courses are accepted, especially since we’re required to take two of them. However, I’m worried this might impact my chances of getting in. I do have a solid understanding of biology, but I struggle with test-taking, which is affecting my current grade. I believe my foundation for university-level biology is strong, but I’m unsure if retaking the course would be viewed negatively or if it would actually help my application.

222,"About a week ago, I received a ticket for not paying for parking. This ticket was justifiable, so I don't have anything to complain about.   
  
Now, as I was leaving campus 2 days ago, I made a legal emergency stop to go pee for probably five minutes total. I notice that stupid yellow ticket on the dash because I had ""no parking area"". I didn't obstruct anything, I didn't stop anyone from going anywhere, but these parking officers for some reason have to ticket me for it. 

When I go to appeal it on the website, I notice that i have TWO tickets. Turns out a different officer ticketed me BEFORE the ticket I saw on my dash.

Now when I go to pay these tickets on the website, even though I appealed both of those, I'm still FORCED to pay for all of them even though only one is due. The website literally does NOT give you the option to pay one; it just holds a gun to your head and forces you to pay all.

223,"Has anyone had the same experience with a prof,

I am in a gender and religion online class, I transferred into the class on the night of 14th. There was a week one module due the first week of class with a comment paper worth 7% I believe.

I was not present for the due date as I was not even enrolled yet, all classes I have been in did not assign assignments first week due to this specific reason as students move classes until week two. 

After I email the prof  I was told that the syllabus has been on the religious studies website since the beginning of the term and it is my fault, and that time management is an a important part of this course and if it does not work for me then this course is not for me? Like what? I wasn’t even registered in the course till week two… 

I guess it is my fault but if I’m not registered in a class how am I expected to complete that given assignment and hand it in if I do not have access to it on avenue. 

I’m wondering if you guys that transferred into classes during the second week were able to complete substitute assignments due to late registration. I’m gonna just accept it but thought it was pretty odd as I’ve never had this happen in other classes I’ve registered late into.

229,"Been thinking about this for quite some time now. It’s still a thought in progress.

People have been complaining about on-campus food being overpriced, while I’m here internally complaining about possibly not being able to spend the majority of my meal plan money (\~2k) before the year ends. I’m aware the remaining balance gets carried over to subsequent years without the for-the-sake-of-it “50% first-year discount,” but I’d rather just make the most of it while I can. 

This is a pretty impulsive thought for the time-being so I’m not exactly sure how to approach or execute it yet, but I suppose I’m honestly down (albeit also somewhat hesitant) to buy anyone food if need be. My main concern would be coming across trolls or unserious people who are just looking to fool around. I wouldn’t say I’m entirely comfortable with the idea of lending my MacCard for the day in case it becomes a game of hot potato either. I’ve already proposed this idea to people I’m familiar with, but they’re either trying to spend their own meal plan money, insist on paying me back somehow, reluctantly give in sometimes, or politely decline altogether.

Would this genuinely be appreciated? Might be a bit challenging and awkward to coordinate, but again, I’m still working through the possibilities.

EDIT: I did mention that this thought has been on my mind and is still in its infancy. It's already starting to feel a bit overwhelming with an influx of requests, and as much as I can only try, I genuinely can’t tend to every individual. That being said, approaching SWC and occasional transactions might be my best bet if I proceed with this, especially closer to the end of the semester.",

243,"If you’re feeling behind, it’s completely normal. The best way to overcome this is to forgive yourself and take the first step. Dwelling on it only makes things harder, so focus on starting, even with a small action.

* Take things step by step. The workload might feel overwhelming, but every little bit helps. Even 10 minutes of studying can make a difference and improve your chances of success.
* Use tools like Quizlet and Anki to create flashcards. These are especially useful for exams that require a lot of memorization and help you stay organized.
* Don’t forget to leverage helpful resources. uNotes is a free platform for past exams and study materials, while CourseHero is another option (requires uploads or a paid subscription). Also, don’t hesitate to ask upper years for advice or old exams.
* Make use of summarization tools. Shorty AI is a great option for summarizing YouTube and Spotify content, and the best part is, it’s free and doesn’t require a login.
* Stay motivated with the help of friends. Struggling together can make the process easier and less stressful. Just be sure to surround yourself with friends who encourage you to stay on track and avoid distractions.

244,So question about men's soccer recruit day in February ,
245,"Both a PSA and call for help. I am on meal plan trad A and currently have $1487 left in my account (which is actually $2974, because every time you pay half comes from this and half comes from the overhead that they took at the beginning of the semester \[no you do not get your food half off, see below\]). I'm wondering where is the best place to buy food, snacks, etc. and stock up to get the best value out of my meal plan without looking like a fiend for raiding everything. Because at the end of the semester, only half of any unused funds get rolled over, not the overhead. You essentially lose half of what's left.

Also, what really annoys me is that the budget includes if you had stayed over the winter break. For reference, there is a budget planner that tells you how much money you should have in your account each week, but it continues to account for the 2-3 weeks over winter break, even though you have to pay extra to stay in res and most students aren't doing this. So now I have about a month's worth of extra money because I went home for reading week and 3 weeks of winter break. Even if I spend the recommended amount of $23/day, I will not come close to using up my money.

From the meal plan website: The BASIC meal account consists of an overhead portion to cover the costs of operating the residence dining halls. The non-refundable, non-prorated overhead portion of 50% of your BASIC meal account will be automatically set aside at the beginning of the school year; however, with every food purchase made at Hospitality Services locations, 50% of the price will be taken from your BASIC account and 50% will be taken from the overhead account in order for you to receive the full value of your meal plan. Any remaining overhead funds are non-refundable and **will not carry forward at the end of the Winter term.**

TLDR: Mandatory meal plan is way too large, want to use my money before half gets lost!",

280,"Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well! ??

(Unnecessary rambles too oops)

So I just graduated from Mac with my undergrad this past summer, and I’m trying to apply to further education. 

I’m a bit conflicted because I know I often hear that Masters degrees usually look at your final years (which I’ve done MUCH better at than the first half of my degree, getting on the dean’s list I guess). So yeah sucks that they’re asking for my GPA, period, but hopefully they still look through transcripts.

However I don’t even see my cumulative gpa written on my transcript, just term by term, so I’m wondering if I’m missing something, or if I’m supposed to be finding that somewhere else? Or am I supposed to do the math myself? I’ve repeated some courses at Mac so hopefully I don’t mess the calculations up, but is there anywhere where it’s officially calculated and written down?

321," TLDR: which second year program should I choose if I want a phd to become a psychologist?

 I’m in grade 12 and want to go into social science. Wondering which second year program to go into because that would affect which courses I choose in the first year. I want to become a psychologist which will need a phd so a program that would help in that would be great. 

 I’m just confused because I don’t know if I should choose social psychology or pnb - but then inside pnb there’s human behaviour, pnb, biopnb, and neuroscience. I’m assuming for me human behaviour or pnb is the best option but I saw there’s a specialization in social psychology for research which I know is important for a phd. 

 The courses I’m taking are kinesiology, data management, biology, human development, health and nutrition, and fitness leadership. I know for pnb calculus and chemistry is important, and as you can see I do not have either. I tried to do functions but it was too hard because I was going through it in grade 11 which caused me to have a bad math foundation - same thing for chem.

I had to wait 20 mins in the cold this morning while 4 busses passed in a row bc they were ""full"" even when there was space in the back. Move to the back!!  Absolutely do not get on the bus and stand 2 steps behind the bus driver if there's an empty bus behind you. 

If you want to talk to your friend on the bus either both of you sit or both of you stand. 

If someone gets off behind you, take their place so someone else can get on!! It's not that hard guys. 

Dont leave your bags/coats on seats, it's rude and adds to the problem. Put them on your lap. 

Take your backpacks off on a crowded bus, you can put them on the ground in between your legs or put them on your chest so they're not pushing into people.
