I feel judged any time I speak my mind and I’m just tired. I don’t wanna be friends anymore and I feel like I can’t do anything about it. Sometimes they make fun of me and it really hurts me and I tell them that but it’s always a joke.

When I was selecting courses for my fourth year fall semester (which I’m in now), I came across Hlthage 2C03 and enrolled, not realizing it was the same course as Econ 2CC3. Unfortunately, it didn’t occur to me that I had already taken the course, likely because I had mentally blocked out much of third year.

Fast forward—due to illness, I deferred my exam for Hlthage 2C03, and just today, I noticed on my transcript that it’s now marked as a repeat course. I realize this was an oversight on my part, and I fully understand the mistake. My concern is that I’m planning to take a fifth year as a GPA booster and aim to apply for grad school and eventually med school. The top two programs I’m interested in both require full-time status, and dropping this course with a “W” would mean I fall below the full-time threshold for the fall term.

I agreed to help and they asked for my debit card which I used and they gave me $10 for a $7.50 ride. I didnt notice at first but when I got home to change my pin because I was already suspicious, they had swapped out my card for someone else's that looked the same. I already made my card void and am getting a replacement, but to whoever comes across something like this, don't fall for it, just make up some excuse and walk away.",
808,"BTW this is really long winded so a TL:DR at the end. 

Okay, so I’m in my second year at Mac and I’ve bought an online textbook before but this time I had a choice between the online version and a physical copy. Idk, it felt really hard to choose between the two options (I also acknowledge that I have pretty bad anxiety, and not everyone struggles with this stuff like I do). There was also the option of finding something online (which I was HEAVILY looking into but couldn’t find anywhere that wasn’t sketchy as hell). Eventually I settled on buying the online version because I could not find a good free online version and the online version is cheaper (but still wayyyyy too much imo). Anyways, when I finally opened everything up and got into the website (which took a LOT of time for some reason - like a lot of opening sites and putting in info) it is the UGLIEST format, like genuinely looks really weird and is kinda weird to navigate. And I get that I’m being a bit annoying with this but for 65 (64.95$) I expect the site to have the ability to change the format to something similar to a PDF or something yk? Overall, I felt okay becuase there wasn’t an online version … guess what, there is an online free PDF and if it looked like shit I wouldn’t be as mad, but it looks like a normal PDF so it looks 10000x better than the version I BOUGHT. Honestly, the format might be good for some people but it is definitely not for me. And again, this is just ONE online textbook, I had another one and the format was meh but still okay. 

Overall, if you need to get an online textbook definitely check out online versions and WAIT for someone in your class to eventually find it. The online textbook is not refundable (understandably) and if it is through BibliU it will look like shit (imo). 

TL:DR - the online textbook through BibliU looks like shit imo and there 99% of the time IS a free online PDF (just wait for a classmate to find it). 

P.S. you don’t even get to keep the online one, you’re only renting it for 6 months ??",

I've had so many people tell me that it gets better after the first year but I need the truth.

I was working out at 6:30pm-8pm yesterday night alone and when I was doing leg presses, a guy asked me how many reps I have left-- which is a normal question to ask. Later on, he approached me on the second floor and said he was new to the gym and asked if I could help him on a few machines, mind you, I'm pretty passive, so I agreed and he asked me to help him with the leg curl machine. It was normal at first, I asked him what year he was in, and turns out, he was a **Grad Student in** **engineering**. (I'm a **FIRST YEAR STUDENT who turned 18 TWO MONTHS AGO**). Knowing my age, he proceeded to ask me how to use the hip abductor machine (where you basically start with your legs spread open or closed and try to open or close it), I didn't feel comfortable doing it, so I told him I didn't know how to. He then proceeded to ask me how to use the side leg raise machine-- which I also didn't know how to do and didn't feel comfortable demonstrating. He said it was fine and perhaps I could teach him some stretches. In my head, stretches seemed the most appropriate and normal but when we went up to the third floor where the dance studios were, he saw that there were around 7-8 people and said nevermind even though it clearly had space to fit us. We went back down afterwards and he decided to ""check the studios upstairs"" one more time and brought me into the same dance studio that had people inside and brought me to the equipment area that was behind a wall inside the studio and said we could stretch there... mind you, the equipment area is not that wide. I got red flags all over and ran to a group of people right as I declined ""stretching"" with him in the equipment area. The group of people hung out with me for around an hour ( we did a yoga class together during that time) and when it was done, he came into the room, I wasn't sure if he was waiting for me or what not... but he talked to the lady instructor who lead the yoga class instead. the group of people snuck me out right after. He wore a green quarter-zip cardigan with cuffed sweats! If anyone also got approached by him please stay safe!",
